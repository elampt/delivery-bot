# delivery-bot
This is an Autonomous Delivery Robot which can be used to deliver food/grocery and other items from one location to another without any human assistance. In the Web UI, the user who is ordering a shipment mentions the pickup point and delivery point and this data will generate the shortest path from the start and end point. The shortest path will be retrieved from **DynamoDB** in AWS and will be sent to the robot and the robot will reach the delivery point following this particular path.
